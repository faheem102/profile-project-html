      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>
        The screenplay by Jeff Nathanson is based on the
        semi-autobiographical<br />
        book of the same name by Frank Abagnale Jr., who claims that before
        his<br />
        19th birthday, he successfully performed cons worth millions of
        dollars<br />
        by posing as a Pan American World Airways pilot, a Georgia doctor, and
        a<br />
        Louisiana parish prosecutor. The historical truth of his story is<br />
        heavily disputed.
